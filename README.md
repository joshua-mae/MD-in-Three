Giving power to users who want to be able diagnose unique symptoms in a matter of seconds through the use of Infermedica's NLP API as well as providing access to common medical terms and news.  I hope to learn the most about Swift and UIKit with this project as well as explore the nuances of iOS development; I want to explore unique ways to handle problem solving in Swift.  This will most likely be my sole app on the app store that I plan to maintain when it goes through.
